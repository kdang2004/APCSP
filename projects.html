    <p class = "text">Here is a project from my summer course from Cal Poly's EPIC program. I made a Rube Goldberg Project using an Arduino. I had to build the actual machine, and then code the Arduino so that the ball would get knocked down, fall into the boat, the fan would move, and then set off a motion sensor that made noise. This was really fun because I learned about Arduino and I got to make modifications to the project.</p>

    <p class = "text">Here is another project from my Cal Poly summer course. We coded a calculator using Python. It allows the user to input what function they want to use the calculator for, and then allows the user to input numbers to perform the operation on, finally returning the result of the calculation. The project entailed learning about Python, and then coding the program with the help of my instructor. This was a meaningful project because I learned another language and it was fun to see what I could do.</p>
